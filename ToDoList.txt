		Configuration
		Not necessary at this time - Webpack configuration bundles all custom javascript starting at the ClientApp/app/components/ directory and traversals through.
		- Remove bootstrap
		Not necessary - webpack --progress shows that the client size bundle is 1.9mb, which is huge so it needs to be compressed.
		- remove libaries that are not used
		- Optimize client side javascript so the global javascript is at access, while the other javascript is not loaded unless component requires it.
