## Christiankaseburg.com will be up shortly, but for now my website is being hosted on http://christiankaseburg.azurewebsites.net/

# Christian Kaseburg's Personal Website
This is my personal website used to showcase my portfolio/experiments, and give the opportunity for clients to contact me.

## Template used: https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices/
I chose JavaScriptServices template so I can utilize using Angular on the front-end, and have all the benefits from ASP.NET Core on the back-end as I build up my portfolio.
